## Installation

Before starting, make sure to check the [Better Auth docs](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/) first.

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Add BetterAuthSwift to your project using Xcode:

1. In Xcode, select **File â†’ Add Package Dependencies**
2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/ouwargui/BetterAuthSwift.git`
3. Select the version you want to use

Or add it to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
      url: "https://github.com/ouwargui/BetterAuthSwift.git",
      .upToNextMajor(from: "0.3.0")
    )
]
```

## Quick Setup

### 1. Initialize the client

```swift
import BetterAuth

let client = BetterAuthClient(
  baseURL: URL(string: "https://your-api.com")!
)
```

### 2. Sign In with Email

```swift
let response = try? await client.signIn.email(with: .init(
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "securepassword"
))
print(response.user.name)

// Session is a @Published variable
print(client.session?.token)

// So is user
print(client.user?.name)
```

### 3. Use in SwiftUI

```swift
import SwiftUI
import BetterAuth

@main
struct MyApp: App {
  @StateObject private var authClient = BetterAuthClient(
    baseURL: URL(string: "https://your-api.com")!
  )

  var body: some Scene {

## Why

Better Auth is an awesome authentication library and after struggling a bit to create bindings for every route I decided to create this package to facilitate the life of the Swift developer.
